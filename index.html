        <p>Welcome to my site! <br> This is a space for me to mash my keyboard in.</p>

        <h1>Who am I?</h1>
        <p>A guy that likes vido gaems. Some of my favorite at the moment are Deadlock and especially ULTRAKILL. 
            I'm also the guy who made ULTRAHUD, although I don't work on it in any significant capacity anymore.</p>
            <hr>
        <h1>Music</h1>
        <p>A lot of my music taste has been influenced by Hakita and his work on ULTRAKILL. 
            Here's some of the artists I have grown to enjoy because of that.</p>
